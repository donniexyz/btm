BTM - Bitronix's JTA transaction manager
========================================
version 1.0, August 4, 2007

 * Moved to Codehaus.
 * Pending JMS sessions are now closed when a JMS connection goes back into the pool.
 * GUI: implemented filtering by GTRID.
 * Made pooling objects directly instanciatable. No need to create another object on
   which createResource() has to be called.
 * Allowed restarting the TM after it has shutdown.


release-notes-1.0-beta2:
* Refactored enlistment algorithm so that XAResource's can now be manually enlisted.
* Implemented Last Resource Commit to allow non-XA resources to participate in XA transactions.

release-notes-1.0-beta3:
* Refactored configuration to allow properties changes at runtime.
* Improved TMJOIN support of Last Resource Commit wrapper.
* Streamlined JMS and JDBC resources wrappers to share most of the infrastructure.
* Refactored shutdown code to allow application code to call it manually.

release-notes-1.0-beta4:
* Fixed race condition in JMS resource wrapper.
* Changed JTA and JMS 1.1 spec files from Sun for the ones coming from Apache as the license is more permissive.
* Refactored 2PC logic to make it possible to use any kind of execution mechanism (synchronous, JDK 1.5+ concurrent package, ...).
* Hardened transaction log files integrity checks and added bitronix.tm.journal.disk.skipCorruptedLogs configuration property to allow the recovery process to skip corrupted log entries.
* Transaction log files are now locked to avoid unexpected collisions.
* JndiXAConnectionFactory now allows security Principal and Credentials to be provided.
* Added resource parameter allowLocalTransactions to disallow non-explicit mixing of xa and non-xa transactions.
